 abstract = {The potential of the vegetation to sequester C is determined by the
balance between assimilation and respiration. Respiration is under
environmental and substrate-driven control, but the circadian clock
might also contribute.
To assess circadian control on night-time dark respiration (R-D) and on
light enhanced dark respiration (LEDR) - the latter providing
information on the metabolic reorganization in the leaf during
light-dark transitions - we performed experiments in macrocosms hosting
canopies of bean and cotton. Under constant darkness (plus constant air
temperature and air humidity), we tested whether circadian regulation of
RD scaled from leaf to canopy respiration. Under constant light (plus
constant air temperature and air humidity), we assessed the potential
for leaf-level circadian regulation of LEDR.
There was a clear circadian oscillation of leaf-level RD in both species
and circadian patterns scaled to the canopy. LEDR was under circadian
control in cotton, but not in bean indicating species-specific controls.
The circadian rhythm of LEDR in cotton might indicate variable
suppression of the normal cyclic function of the
tricarboxylic-acid-cycle in the light. Since circadian regulation is
assumed to act as an adaptive memory to adjust plant metabolism based on
environmental conditions from previous days, circadian control of RD may
help to explain temporal variability of ecosystem respiration. (C) 2017
