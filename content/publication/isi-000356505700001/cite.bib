 abstract = {Evapotranspiration is a major component of the water cycle, yet only
daytime transpiration is currently considered in Earth system and
agricultural sciences. This contrasts with physiological studies where
25% or more of water losses have been reported to occur occurring
overnight at leaf and plant scales. This gap probably arose from
limitations in techniques to measure nocturnal water fluxes at ecosystem
scales, a gap we bridge here by using lysimeters under controlled
environmental conditions. The magnitude of the nocturnal water losses
(12-23% of daytime water losses) in rowcrop monocultures of bean
(annual herb) and cotton (woody shrub) would be globally an order of
magnitude higher than documented responses of global evapotranspiration
to climate change (51-98 vs. 7-8 mm yr(-1)). Contrary to daytime
responses and to conventional wisdom, nocturnal transpiration was not
affected by previous radiation loads or carbon uptake, and showed a
temporal pattern independent of vapour pressure deficit or temperature,
because of endogenous controls on stomatal conductance via circadian
regulation. Our results have important implications from largescale
ecosystem modelling to crop production: homeostatic water losses justify
simple empirical predictive functions, and circadian controls show a
fine-tune control that minimizes water loss while potentially increasing
posterior carbon uptake.},
