 abstract = {Intraspecific variation in biomass production responses to elevated
atmospheric carbon dioxide (eCO(2)) could influence tree species'
ecological and evolutionary responses to climate change. However, the
physiological mechanisms underlying genotypic variation in
responsiveness to eCO(2) remain poorly understood. In this study, we
grew 17 Eucalyptus camaldulensis Dehnh. subsp. camaldulensis genotypes
(representing provenances from four different climates) under ambient
atmospheric CO2 and eCO(2). We tested whether genotype leaf-scale
photosynthetic and whole-tree carbon (C) allocation responses to eCO(2)
were predictive of genotype biomass production responses to eCO(2).
Averaged across genotypes, growth at eCO(2) increased in situ leaf net
photosynthesis (Anet) (29%) and leaf starch concentrations (37%).
Growth at eCO(2) reduced the maximum carboxylation capacity of Rubisco
(-4%) and leaf nitrogen per unit area (Narea,-6%), but Narea
calculated on a total non-structural carbohydrate-free basis was similar
between treatments. Growth at eCO(2) also increased biomass production
and altered C allocation by reducing leaf area ratio (-11%) and stem
mass fraction (SMF,-9%), and increasing leaf mass area (18%) and leaf
mass fraction (5%). Overall, we found few significant CO2 x provenance
or CO2 x genotype (within provenance) interactions. However, genotypes
that showed the largest increases in total dry mass at eCO(2) had larger
increases in root mass fraction (with larger decreases in SMF) and
photosynthetic nitrogen-use efficiency (PNUE) with CO2 enrichment. These
results indicate that genetic differences in PNUE and carbon sink
utilization (in roots) are both important predictors of tree
productivity responsiveness to eCO(2).},
