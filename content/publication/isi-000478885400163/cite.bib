 abstract = {Vegetables, once harvested and stored on supermarket shelves, continue
to perform biochemical adjustments due to their modular nature and their
ability to retain physiological autonomy. They can live after being
harvested. In particular, the content of some essential nutraceuticals,
such as carotenoids, can be altered in response to environmental or
internal stimuli. Therefore, in the present study, we wondered whether
endogenous rhythms continue to operate in commercial vegetables and if
so, whether vegetable nutritional quality could be altered by such
cycles. Our experimental model consisted of rocket leaves entrained
under light/darkness cycles of 12/12 h over 3 days, and then we examined
free-run oscillations for 2 days under continuous light or continuous
darkness, which led to chlorophyll and carotenoid oscillations in both
constant conditions. Given the importance of preserving food quality,
the existence of such internal rhythms during continuous conditions may
open new research perspective in nutrition science. However, while
chromatographic techniques employed to determine pigment composition are
accurate, they are also time-consuming and expensive. Here we propose
for the first time an alternative method to estimate pigment content and
the nutritional quality by the use of non-destructive and in situ
optical techniques. These results are promising for nutritional quality
assessments.},
