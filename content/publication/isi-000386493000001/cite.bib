 abstract = {OzFlux is the regional Australian and New Zealand flux tower network
that aims to provide a continental-scale national research facility to
monitor and assess trends, and improve predictions, of Australia's
terrestrial biosphere and climate. This paper describes the evolution,
design, and current status of OzFlux as well as provides an overview of
data processing. We analyse measurements from all sites within the
Australian portion of the OzFlux network and two sites from New Zealand.
The response of the Australian biomes to climate was largely consistent
with global studies except that Australian systems had a lower ecosystem
water-use efficiency. Australian semi-arid/arid ecosystems are important
because of their huge extent (70 %) and they have evolved with common
moisture limitations. We also found that Australian ecosystems had a
similar radiation-use efficiency per unit leaf area compared to global
values that indicates a convergence toward a similar biochemical
efficiency. The two New Zealand sites represented extremes in
productivity for a moist temperate climate zone, with the grazed dairy
farm site having the highest GPP of any OzFlux site (2620 gC m(-2)
yr(-1)) and the natural raised peat bog site having a very low GPP (820
gC m(-2) yr(-1)). The paper discusses the utility of the flux data and
the synergies between flux, remote sensing, and modelling. Lastly, the
paper looks ahead at the future direction of the network and concludes
that there has been a substantial contribution by OzFlux, and
considerable opportunities remain to further advance our understanding
of ecosystem response to disturbances, including drought, fire, land-use
and land-cover change, land management, and climate change, which are
relevant both nationally and internationally. It is suggested that a
synergistic approach is required to address all of the spatial,
ecological, human, and cultural challenges of managing the delicately
balanced ecosystems in Australasia.},
