 abstract = {Extreme climatic conditions are major drivers of ecosystem function and
dynamics and their frequency is increasing under climate change.
Climatic conditions interact with local microtopography, which might
either buffer or exacerbate the degree of climatic stress. Here we
sought to understand how extremely dry growing seasons affected the
composition and productivity of desert ephemeral communities growing in
sand dunes from the Gurbantunggut desert in Central Asia, and to which
extent did microtopography modulate the response. We set up a rainfall
manipulation study on four sand dune microtopographies and, during two
consecutive years, we measured soil moisture, nutrients and texture,
ephemeral layer composition, plant phenology, biomass accumulation and
biomass allocation patterns for the dominant species. We observed
significant biomass reductions during the extreme drought but plant
community richness and composition were not affected, indicating that
the composition of the ephemeral layer in this desert ecosystem may
resist under extreme conditions. Additionally, extreme drought increased
biomass allocation to reproductive organs of the dominant species. There
were also significant microtopographic effects as the sensitivity of
biomass to drought in western aspects was larger than in eastern
aspects. Our results indicate that previously overlooked
microtopographical differences may mediate the impact of climate change
on plant communities. (c) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},
