 abstract = {As a result of climate change warmer temperatures are projected through
the 21st century and are already increasing above modelled predictions.
Apart from increases in the mean, warm/hot temperature extremes are
expected to become more prevalent in the future, along with an increase
in the frequency of droughts. It is crucial to better understand the
response of terrestrial ecosystems to such temperature extremes for
predicting land-surface feedbacks in a changing climate. While
land-surface feedbacks in drought conditions and during heat waves have
been reported from Europe and the US, direct observations of the impact
of such extremes on the carbon and water cycles in Australia have been
lacking. During the 2012/2013 summer, Australia experienced a
record-breaking heat wave with an exceptional spatial extent that lasted
for several weeks. In this study we synthesised eddy-covariance
measurements from seven woodlands and one forest site across three
biogeographic regions in southern Australia. These observations were
combined with model results from BIOS2 (Haverd et al., 2013a, b) to
investigate the effect of the summer heat wave on the carbon and water
exchange of terrestrial ecosystems which are known for their resilience
toward hot and dry conditions. We found that water-limited woodland and
energy-limited forest ecosystems responded differently to the heat wave.
During the most intense part of the heat wave, the woodlands experienced
decreased latent heat flux (23% of background value), increased Bowen
ratio (154 %) and reduced carbon uptake (60 %). At the same time the
forest ecosystem showed increased latent heat flux (151 %), reduced
Bowen ratio (19 %) and increased carbon uptake (112 %). Higher
temperatures caused increased ecosystem respiration at all sites (up to
139 %). During daytime all ecosystems remained carbon sinks, but carbon
uptake was reduced in magnitude. The number of hours during which the
ecosystem acted as a carbon sink was also reduced, which switched the
woodlands into a carbon source on a daily average. Precipitation
occurred after the first, most intense part of the heat wave, and the
subsequent cooler temperatures in the temperate woodlands led to
recovery of the carbon sink, decreased the Bowen ratio (65 %) and hence
increased evaporative cooling. Gross primary productivity in the
woodlands recovered quickly with precipitation and cooler temperatures
but respiration remained high. While the forest proved relatively
resilient to this short-term heat extreme the response of the woodlands
is the first direct evidence that the carbon sinks of large areas of
Australia may not be sustainable in a future climate with an increased
number, intensity and duration of heat waves.},
