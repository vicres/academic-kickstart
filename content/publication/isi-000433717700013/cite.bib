 abstract = {Rising atmospheric [CO2] and associated climate change are expected to
modify primary productivity across a range of ecosystems globally.
Increasing aridity is predicted to reduce grassland productivity,
although rising [CO2] and associated increases in plant water use
efficiency may partially offset the effect of drying on growth.
Difficulties arise in predicting the direction and magnitude of future
changes in ecosystem productivity, due to limited field experimentation
investigating climate and CO2 interactions. We use repeat near-surface
digital photography to quantify the effects of water availability and
experimentally manipulated elevated [CO2] (eCO(2)) on understorey live
foliage cover and biomass over three growing seasons in a temperate
grassy woodland in south-eastern Australia. We hypothesised that (i)
understorey herbaceous productivity is dependent upon soil water
availability, and (ii) that eCO(2) will increase productivity, with
greatest stimulation occurring under conditions of low water
availability. Soil volumetric water content (VWC) determined foliage
cover and growth rates over the length of the growing season (August to
March), with low VWC (< 0.1 m(3) m(-3)) reducing productivity. However,
eCO(2) did not increase herbaceous cover and biomass over the duration
of the experiment, or mitigate the effects of low water availability on
understorey growth rates and cover. Our findings suggest that projected
increases in aridity in temperate woodlands are likely to lead to
reduced understorey productivity, with little scope for eCO(2) to offset
these changes.},
