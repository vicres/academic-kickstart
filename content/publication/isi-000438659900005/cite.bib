 abstract = {Circadian regulation is an endogenous self-sustaining mechanism that
drives temporal gene expression and, amongst others, affects the diurnal
patterns of photosynthesis (A) and stomatal conductance (g(s)). Here we
review current knowledge on how circadian regulation drives diurnal gas
exchange from genes to ecosystems in the field. Molecular mechanisms
underlying the structure of circadian clocks and how they regulate A and
g(s), in a few model species are starting to be elucidated but
additional data are required to understand regulation across
phylogenies, especially within the gymnosperms, and across environments
and scales. Circadian rhythms were responsible for 15-25% and for
30-35% of the daytime oscillations in A and g(s) respectively, across
the C3 and C4 species for which data are available. Consequently,
circadian effects over diurnal gas exchange are of similar magnitude to
the effects of temperature or vapor pressure deficit. Moreover, recent
findings indicate how circadian rhythms could exert significant impacts
on ecosystem patterns of gas exchange, which would challenge
conventional approaches to derive the environmental flux dependences.
Progress in transferring laboratory findings to the field is being
hampered by lack of suitable experimental and modeling facilities that
can disentangle circadian effects from environmental responses in the
field and in ecosystems, and methodological recommendations are offered.
The effects of environmental stressors on circadian regulation of gas
exchange are also poorly understood. We document how circadian control
of gas exchange may be adaptive by allowing plants to anticipate highly
predictable environmental cues, but also by increasing the diversity of
potential gas exchange responses to environmental variation in plant
populations.},
