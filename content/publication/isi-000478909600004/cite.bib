 abstract = {Nocturnal stomatal conductance contributes to water loss at night
without carbon gain in C-3 or C-4 plants because photosynthesis does not
occur in the dark. The functional relevance of nocturnal conductance
thus remains an unresolved conundrum. Here, we review and re-analyse
previously published datasets on nocturnal conductance (g(n)) globally
(176 species) to synthesize our current understanding on its potential
biological function and to identify remaining research gaps. We found
that g(n) was positively correlated with relative growth rate, which is
compatible with the postulate that circadian-driven nocturnal
conductance enhances predawn stomatal conductance, thereby priming
stomata for photosynthesis in early daylight. The variation in g(n)
across plant species and functional types was not consistent with the
hypotheses that the main function of g(n) is to: remove excess CO2,
which might limit growth; enhance oxygen delivery to the functional
sapwood; enhance nutrient supply; or that g(n) is due to stomatal
leakiness. We suggest further study regarding the potential of g(n) to
be an important functional and ecological trait influencing competitive
outcomes and we outline a research programme to achieve that objective.},
