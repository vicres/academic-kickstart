 abstract = {There is increasing evidence that the circadian clock is a significant
driver of photosynthesis that becomes apparent when environmental cues
are experimentally held constant. We studied whether the composition of
photosynthetic pigments is under circadian regulation, and whether
pigment oscillations lead to rhythmic changes in photochemical
efficiency. To address these questions, we maintained canopies of bean
and cotton, after an entrainment phase, under constant (light or
darkness) conditions for 30-48 h. Photosynthesis and quantum yield
peaked at subjective noon, and non-photochemical quenching peaked at
night. These oscillations were not associated with parallel changes in
carbohydrate content or xanthophyll cycle activity. We observed robust
oscillations of Chl a/b during constant light in both species, and also
under constant darkness in bean, peaking when it would have been night
during the entrainment (subjective nights). These oscillations could be
attributed to the synthesis and/or degradation of trimeric
light-harvesting complex II (reflected by the rhythmic changes in Chl
a/b), with the antenna size minimal at night and maximal around
subjective noon. Considering together the oscillations of pigments and
photochemistry, the observed pattern of changes is counterintuitive if
we assume that the plant strategy is to avoid photodamage, but
consistent with a strategy where non-stressed plants maximize
photosynthesis.},
