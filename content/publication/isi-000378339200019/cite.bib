 abstract = {The occurrence of large, high-intensity wildfires requires plant
biomass, or fuel, that is sufficiently dry to burn. This poses the
question, what is ``sufficiently dryâ€³? Until recently, the ability to
address this question has been constrained by the spatiotemporal scale
of available methods to monitor the moisture contents of both dead and
live fuels. Here we take advantage of recent developments in macroscale
monitoring of fuel moisture through a combination of remote sensing and
climatic modeling. We show there are clear thresholds of fuel moisture
content associated with the occurrence of wildfires in forests and
woodlands. Furthermore, we show that transformations in fuel moisture
conditions across these thresholds can occur rapidly, within a month.
Both the approach presented here, and our findings, can be immediately
applied and may greatly improve fire risk assessments in forests and
woodlands globally.},
