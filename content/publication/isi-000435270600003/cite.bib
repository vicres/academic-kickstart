 abstract = {Stomatal response to environmental conditions forms the backbone of all
ecosystem and carbon cycle models, but is largely based on empirical
relationships. Evolutionary theories of stomatal behaviour are critical
for guarding against prediction errors of empirical models under future
climates. Longstanding theory holds that stomata maximise fitness by
acting to maintain constant marginal water use efficiency over a given
time horizon, but a recent evolutionary theory proposes that stomata
instead maximise carbon gain minus carbon costs/risk of hydraulic
damage. Using data from 34 species that span global forest biomes, we
find that the recent carbon-maximisation optimisation theory is widely
supported, revealing that the evolution of stomatal regulation has not
been primarily driven by attainment of constant marginal water use
efficiency. Optimal control of stomata to manage hydraulic risk is
likely to have significant consequences for ecosystem fluxes during
drought, which is critical given projected intensification of the global
hydrological cycle.},
