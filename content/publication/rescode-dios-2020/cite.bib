 abstract = {The physiological ecology of plant-fire relations, or pyrophysiology, seeks to provide a mechanistic and predictive understanding of the reciprocal interactions that exist between plants and fire. That is, by understanding the processes underlying plant structure and function, we may gain further insight on how wildfires affect plants as well as on how the physiological traits that affect wildfires develop. This chapter presents a general introduction to the topics of pyrophysiology and to wildfire science, and it ends by presenting the book structure.},
