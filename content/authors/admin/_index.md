I am a broadly trained plant physiological ecologist and my currently research is focused on 3 areas: 

1) Circadian ecology -  trying to understand the drivers of diurnal, seasonal and annual rhythms of plant growth and gas exchange; 
2) Pyrophysiology - increasing knowledge on the physiological mechanisms that affect fire activity and on how fires shape plant species structure and function; 
3) Fire-Atmosphere interactions- meteorological drivers of wildfire activity.

I am a member of the Editorial Boards of [New Phytologist](https://nph.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/14698137), [Trees](https://www.springer.com/journal/468), [Plant Ecology and Diversity](https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/tped20), [Forests](https://www.mdpi.com/journal/forests), [Forest Systems](http://revistas.inia.es/index.php/fs) and [Frontiers in Forests and Global Change](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/forests-and-global-change). 

A few years ago I contributed to the [IPCC 5 AR](https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar5/syr/)
