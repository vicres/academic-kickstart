 abstract = {Stressful episodic weather is likely to affect the C balance of trees as
the climate changes, potentially altering survival. However, the role of
elevated CO2 concentration ([CO2]) in tolerating off-season episodic
extremes is not clear. We tested for interactive effects of elevated CO2
and springtime heat stress on photosynthesis for seven genotypes of
Eucalyptus camaldulensis Dehnh. var. camaldulensis, representing its
widespread distribution across south-eastern Australia. We grew clonal
material under glasshouse conditions of ambient (aCO(2); 400 parts per
million (ppm)) or elevated (eCO(2); 640ppm) [CO2], and air
temperatures of 25:17 degrees C (day:night), and measured the electron
transport rate in PSII (ETR), stomatal conductance to water vapour
(g(s)) and net CO2 assimilation (A). Measurements were made before,
during and after a four-day temperature excursion of 35:27 degrees C.
ETR and A were similar to 17% higher for plants grown in eCO(2) than in
aCO(2). Photosynthesis remained stable for plants in eCO(2) during the
heatwave. Based on the effect size ratio (eCO(2):aCO(2)), g(s) and ETR
were temporarily affected more by the heatwave than A. A reduction in
ETR in eCO(2) was the only lasting effect of the heatwave. There were no
significant differences among genotypes. Correlations between
photosynthesis and climate of origin differed for plants grown in aCO(2)
compared with eCO(2), suggesting potential complex and multiple control
points on photosynthesis.},
