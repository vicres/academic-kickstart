 abstract = {Circadian resonance, whereby a plant's endogenous rhythms are tuned to
match environmental cues, has been repeatedly shown to be adaptive,
although the underlying mechanisms remain elusive. Concomitantly, the
adaptive value of nocturnal transpiration in C-3 plants remains unknown
because it occurs without carbon assimilation. These seemingly unrelated
processes are interconnected because circadian regulation drives
temporal patterns in nocturnal stomatal conductance, with maximum values
occurring immediately before dawn for many species. We grew individuals
of six Eucalyptus camaldulensis genotypes in naturally lit glasshouses
and measured sunset, predawn and midday leaf gas exchange and
whole-plant biomass production. We tested whether sunrise anticipation
by the circadian clock and subsequent increases in genotype predawn
stomatal conductance led to rapid stomatal opening upon illumination,
ultimately affecting genotype differences in carbon assimilation and
growth. We observed faster stomatal responses to light inputs at sunrise
in genotypes with higher predawn stomatal conductance. Moreover, early
morning and midday stomatal conductance and carbon assimilation, leaf
area and total plant biomass were all positively correlated with predawn
stomatal conductance across genotypes. Our results lead to the novel
hypothesis that genotypic variation in the circadian-regulated capacity
to anticipate sunrise could be an important factor underlying
intraspecific variation in tree growth.},
