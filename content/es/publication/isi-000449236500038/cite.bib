 abstract = {The moisture content of live fuels is an important determinant of forest
flammability. Current approaches for modelling live fuel moisture
content typically focus on the use of drought indices. However, these
have mixed success partly because of species-specific differences in
drought responses. Here we seek to understand the physiological
mechanisms driving changes in live fuel moisture content, and to
investigate the potential for incorporating plant physiological traits
into live fuel moisture models. We measured the dynamics of leaf
moisture content, access to water resources (through stable isotope
analyses) and physiological traits (including leaf water potential,
stomatal conductance, and cellular osmotic and elastic adjustments)
across a fire season in a Mediterranean mixed forest in Catalonia, NE
Spain. We found that differences in both seasonal variation and minimum
values of live fuel moisture content were a function of access to water
resources and plant physiological traits. Specifically, those species
with the lowest minimum moisture content and largest seasonal variation
in moisture (Cistus albidus: 49-137% and Rognarinus officinalis:
47-144%) were most reliant on shallow soil water and had the lowest
values of predawn leaf water potential. Species with the smallest
variation in live fuel moisture content (Pinus nigra: 96-116% and
Quercus ilex: 56-91%) exhibited isohydric behaviour (little variation
in midday leaf water potential, and relatively tight regulation of
stomata in response to soil drying). Of the traits measured, predawn
leaf water potential provided the strongest predictor of live fuel
moisture content (R-2 = 0.63, AIC = 249), outperforming two commonly
used drought indices (both with R-2 = 0.49, AIC = 258). This is the
first study to explicitly link fuel moisture with plant physiology and
our findings demonstrate the potential and importance of incorporating
ecophysiological plant traits to investigating seasonal changes in fuel
moisture and, more broadly, forest flammability.},
