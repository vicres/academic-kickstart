 abstract = {Questions: Woody plant encroachment into former grasslands currently
represents a major physiognomic shift globally. Seedling establishment
is a critical demographic bottleneck and is considered to be alleviated
by increases in water availability and negatively impacted by
interactions with grasses, particularly when water stress increases.
However, interactions with grasses that are not actively competing for
resources ('passive interactions' when grasses are dead) has seldom been
considered. Could the transition from a live to a dead grass (litter)
canopy favour recruitment of woody seedlings in a semi-arid grassland of
the American SW? How does the sign and intensity of grass-seedling
interactions change across drastically different summer precipitation
regimes with and without passive interactions?
Location: Sonoran Desert shrub savanna at the Santa Rita Experimental
Range, near Tucson, AZ, US.
Methods: Four cohorts of Prosopis velutina seeds were planted annually
(20022005) under rainout shelters that intercepted all incoming
precipitation on a soil with sandy loam texture. Summer precipitation
was manipulated to simulate either a 50% increase or decrease in the
long-termmean, and cover was manipulated to simulate a grassland
dominated by the C-4 bunchgrass Heteropogon contortus or left
unvegetated. Emergence and survival of P. velutina was monitored and
compared across cover types, along with monitoring of soil water content
and light interception.
Results: Strong active competition was observed with live grasses, under
both summer drought and also under ample summer water supply. However,
the pattern was reversed and strong passive facilitation of P. velutina
was observed over time when grass canopies died and remained in place.
This passive facilitation under dry summers was so strong that
recruitment under dead grass conditions was comparable to that observed
when ample water supply removed the effects of competition on
unvegetated plots.
Conclusions: After significant mortality of standing grass canopies,
which typically compete for limited soil moisture resources, rates of
recruitment by shrubs may increase even with significant seasonal
drought. This work extends our understanding of interactions among
co-located organisms and their effects on plant community dynamics, and
introduces a new hypothesis on how grass litter facilitates woody plant
encroachment during seasonal droughts.},
