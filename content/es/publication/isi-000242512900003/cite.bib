 abstract = {This paper synthesizes and reviews literature concerning climate change
effects on Mediterranean forest ecology and management as well as the
restorative techniques necessary to maintain forest health, forest yield
and biodiversity. Climate change compounded with trends of rural
abandonment are likely to diminish forested areas within the
Mediterranean basin that will be replaced by fire prone shrub
communities. This could be favoured by outbreaks of pathogens, fire and
other large-scale disturbances. Landscape fragmentation is expected to
impede species migration. Annual increments and subsequent income from
forests are expected to decrease. Reafforestations are necessary to
ensure the presence of propagules of forest species and their
site-specific varieties best adapted to future climatic conditions even
though they may be different from the present forest-plant community.
Current challenges in biodiversity conservation can only be met by
afforestations whose main objective is to maintain ecosystem
functioning. A new silviculture must emerge encompassing these habitat
displacement and economic concerns while maximizing carbon
sequestration.},
