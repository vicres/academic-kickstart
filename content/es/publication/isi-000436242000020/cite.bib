 abstract = {A trend of increasing woody plant density, or woody thickening, has been
observed across grassland and woodland ecosystems globally. It has been
proposed that increasing atmospheric [CO2] is a major driver of broad
scale woody thickening, though few field-based experiments have tested
this hypothesis. Our study utilises a Free Air CO2 Enrichment experiment
to examine the effect of elevated [CO2] (eCO(2)) on three mechanisms
that can cause woody thickening, namely (i) woody plant recruitment,
(ii) seedling growth, and (iii) post-disturbance resprouting. The study
took place in a eucalypt-dominated temperate grassy woodland. Annual
assessments show that juvenile woody plant recruitment occurred over the
first 3 years of CO2 fumigation, though eCO(2) did not affect rates of
recruitment. Manipulative experiments were established to examine the
effect of eCO(2) on above-ground seedling growth using transplanted
Eucalyptus tereticornis (Myrtaceae) and Hakea sericea (Proteaceae)
seedlings. There was no positive effect of eCO(2) on biomass of either
species following 12 months of exposure to treatments. Lignotubers
(i.e., resprouting organs) of harvested E. tereticornis seedlings that
were retained in situ for an additional year were used to examine
resprouting response. The likelihood of resprouting and biomass of
resprouts increased with lignotuber volume, which was not itself
affected by eCO(2). The presence of herbaceous competitors and
defoliation by invertebrates and pathogens were found to greatly reduce
growth and/or resprouting response of seedlings. Our findings do not
support the hypothesis that future increases in atmospheric [CO2]
will, by itself, promote woody plant recruitment in eucalypt-dominated
temperate grassy woodlands.},
