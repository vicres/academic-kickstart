 abstract = {Globe-LFMC is an extensive global database of live fuel moisture content
(LFMC) measured from 1,383 sampling sites in 11 countries: Argentina,
Australia, China, France, Italy, Senegal, Spain, South Africa, Tunisia,
United Kingdom and the United States of America. The database contains
161,717 individual records based on in situ destructive samples used to
measure LFMC, representing the amount of water in plant leaves per unit
of dry matter. The primary goal of the database is to calibrate and
validate remote sensing algorithms used to predict LFMC. However, this
database is also relevant for the calibration and validation of dynamic
global vegetation models, eco-physiological models of plant water stress
as well as understanding the physiological drivers of spatiotemporal
variation in LFMC at local, regional and global scales. Globe-LFMC
should be useful for studying LFMC trends in response to environmental
change and LFMC influence on wildfire occurrence, wildfire behavior, and
overall vegetation health.},
