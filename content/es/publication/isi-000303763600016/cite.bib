 abstract = {It is often assumed that daytime patterns of ecosystem carbon
assimilation are mostly driven by direct physiological responses to
exogenous environmental cues. Under limited environmental variability,
little variation in carbon assimilation should thus be expected unless
endogenous plant controls on carbon assimilation, which regulate
photosynthesis in time, are active. We evaluated this assumption with
eddy flux data, and we selected periods when net ecosystem exchange
(NEE) was decoupled from environmental variability in seven sites from
highly contrasting biomes across a 74 degrees latitudinal gradient over
a total of 36 site-years. Under relatively constant conditions of light,
temperature, and other environmental factors, significant diurnal NEE
oscillations were observed at six sites, where daily NEE variation was
between 20% and 90% of that under variable environmental conditions.
These results are consistent with fluctuations driven by the circadian
clock and other endogenous processes. Our results open a promising
avenue of research for a more complete understanding of ecosystem fluxes
that integrates from cellular to ecosystem processes.},
