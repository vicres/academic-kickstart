 abstract = {The assessment of genetic differentiation in functional traits is
fundamental towards understanding the adaptive characteristics of forest
species. While traditional phenotyping techniques are costly and
time-consuming, remote sensing data derived from cameras mounted on
unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) provide potentially valid
high-throughput information for assessing morphophysiological
differences among tree populations. In this work, we test for genetic
variation in vegetation indices (VIs) and canopy temperature among
populations of Pinus halepensis as proxies for canopy architecture, leaf
area, photosynthetic pigments, photosynthetic efficiency and water use.
The interpopulation associations between vegetation properties and
above-ground growth (stem volume) were also assessed. Three flights
(July 2016, November 2016 and May 2017) were performed in a genetic
trial consisting of 56 populations covering a large part of the species
range. Multispectral (visible and near infrared wavelengths), RGB (red,
green, blue) and thermal images were used to estimate canopy temperature
and vegetation cover (VC) and derive several VIs. Differences among
populations emerged consistently across flights for VC and VIs related
to leaf area, indicating genetic divergence in crown architecture.
Population differences in indices related to photosynthetic pigments
emerged only in May 2017 and were probably related to a contrasting
phenology of needle development. Conversely, the low population
differentiation for the same indices in July 2016 and November 2016
suggested weak interpopulation variation in the photosynthetic machinery
of mature needles of P. halepensis. Population differences in canopy
temperature found in July 2016 were indicative of variation in stomatal
regulation under drought stress. Stem volume correlated with indices
related to leaf area (positively) and with canopy temperature
(negatively), indicating a strong influence of canopy properties and
stomatal conductance on above-ground growth at the population level.
Specifically, a combination of VIs and canopy temperature accounted for
about 60% of population variability in stem volume of adult trees. This
is the first study to propose UAV remote sensing as an effective tool
for screening genetic variation in morphophysiological traits of adult
forest trees.},
