 abstract = {Changing frequencies of extreme weather events and shifting fire seasons
call for enhanced capability to forecast where and when forested
landscapes switch from a nonflammable (i.e., wet fuel) state to the
highly flammable (i.e., dry fuel) state required for catastrophic forest
fires. Current forest fire danger indices used in Europe, North America,
and Australia rate potential fire behavior by combining numerical
indices of fuel moisture content, potential rate of fire spread, and
fire intensity. These numerical rating systems lack the physical basis
required to reliably quantify forest flammability outside the
environments of their development or under novel climate conditions.
Here, we argue that exceedance of critical forest flammability
thresholds is a prerequisite for major forest fires and therefore early
warning systems should be based on a reliable prediction of fuel
moisture content plus a regionally calibrated model of how forest fire
activity responds to variation in fuel moisture content. We demonstrate
the potential of this approach through a case study in Portugal. We use
a physically based fuel moisture model with historical weather and fire
records to identify critical fuel moisture thresholds for forest fire
activity and then show that the catastrophic June 2017 forest fires in
central Portugal erupted shortly after fuels in the region dried out to
historically unprecedented levels.},
