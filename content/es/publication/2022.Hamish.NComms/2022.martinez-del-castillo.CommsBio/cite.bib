 abstract = {The growth of past, present, and future forests was, is and will
be affected by climate variability. This multifaceted
relationship has been assessed in several regional studies, but
spatially resolved, large-scale analyses are largely missing so
far. Here we estimate recent changes in growth of 5800 beech
trees (Fagus sylvatica L.) from 324 sites, representing the full
geographic and climatic range of species. Future growth trends
were predicted considering state-of-the-art climate scenarios.
The validated models indicate growth declines across large region
of the distribution in recent decades, and project severe future
growth declines ranging from −20% to more than −50% by 2090,
depending on the region and climate change scenario (i.e. CMIP6
SSP1-2.6 and SSP5-8.5). Forecasted forest productivity losses are
most striking towards the southern distribution limit of Fagus
sylvatica, in regions where persisting atmospheric high-pressure
systems are expected to increase drought severity. The projected
21st century growth changes across Europe indicate serious
ecological and economic consequences that require immediate
forest adaptation.},
