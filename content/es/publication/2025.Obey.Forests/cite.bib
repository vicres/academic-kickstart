 abstract = {Mountains are global biodiversity hotspots but face the danger of habitat loss, especially at lower elevations due to climate-warming-induced forest dieback. In the Gongga Mountains (SW China), Abies fabri trees at 2800 m show increased mortality, yet the causes remain unclear. We assessed climatic influences and bark beetle infestations on tree vigor and radial growth, comparing healthy and declining trees at 2800, 3000, and 3600 m elevations. Leaf nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations were measured to evaluate nutrient status. From 1950 to 2019, mean annual temperatures rose at all elevations, while precipitation decreased at low elevations, negatively correlating with temperature. Such warmer, drier conditions impaired low-elevation trees. The decline in A. fabri growth began in the late 1990s to early 2000s, with an earlier and more pronounced onset at lower elevations. A clear lag is evident, as trees at 3000 m and 3600 m showed either delayed or minimal decline during the same period. High-elevation trees experienced more stable climate and better nutrient availability, supporting greater growth and leaf nitrogen in healthy trees. Bark beetle infestations were worst in declining trees at the highest elevation. Our results reveal that A. fabri vigor shifts along elevation gradients reflect interactions between abiotic and biotic stressors, especially aridification.},
