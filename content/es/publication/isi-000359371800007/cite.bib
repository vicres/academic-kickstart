 abstract = {Climate change threatens the ability of agriculture and forestry to meet
growing global demands for food, fibre and wood products. Information
gathered from genotype-by-environment interactions (GxE), which
demonstrate intraspecific variation in phenotypic plasticity (the
ability of a genotype to alter its phenotype in response to
environmental change), may prove important for bolstering agricultural
and forest productivity under climate change. Nonetheless, very few
studies have explicitly quantified genotype plasticity-productivity
relationships in agriculture or forestry. Here, we conceptualize the
importance of intraspecific variation in agricultural and forest species
plasticity, and discuss the physiological and genetic factors
contributing to intraspecific variation in phenotypic plasticity. Our
discussion highlights the need for an integrated understanding of the
mechanisms of GxE, more extensive assessments of genotypic responses to
climate change under field conditions, and explicit testing of genotype
plasticity-productivity relationships. Ultimately, further investigation
of intraspecific variation in phenotypic plasticity in agriculture and
forestry may prove important for identifying genotypes capable of
increasing or sustaining productivity under more extreme climatic
conditions.
