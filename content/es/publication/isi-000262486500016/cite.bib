 abstract = {The hypothesis that drought intensity constrains the recovery of
photosynthesis from drought was tested in the C-3 woody legume Prosopis
velutina, and the mechanisms underlying this constraint examined.
Hydraulic status and gas exchange were measured the day before a 39 mm
precipitation pulse, and up to 7 d afterwards. The experiment was
conducted under rainout shelters, established on contrasting soil
textures and with different vegetation cover at the Santa Rita
Experimental Range in southeastern Arizona, USA.
Rates of photosynthesis and stomatal conductance after re-watering, as
well as the number of days necessary for photosynthesis to recover after
re-watering, were negatively correlated with predawn water potential, a
measure of drought intensity (R-2 = 0.83, 0.64 and 0.92, respectively).
Photosynthetic recovery was incomplete when the vascular capacity for
water transport had been severely impaired (percentage loss of hydraulic
conductance > 80%) during the drought, which largely increased stomatal
limitations. However, changes in biochemical capacity or in mesophyll
conductance did not explain the observed pattern of photosynthesis
recovery. Although the control that hydraulic limitations impose on
photosynthesis recovery had been previously inferred, the first
empirical test of this concept is reported here.
