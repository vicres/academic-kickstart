 abstract = {Accurate estimates of the d13C value of CO2 respired from roots
(d13CR_root) and leaves (d13CR_leaf) are important for tracing and
understanding changes in C fluxes at the ecosystem scale. Yet the
mechanisms underlying temporal variation in these isotopic signals are
not fully resolved. We measured d13CR_leaf, d13CR_root, and the d13C
values and concentrations of glucose and sucrose in leaves and roots in
the C4 grass Sporobolus wrightii and the C3 tree Prosopis velutina in a
savanna ecosystem in southeastern Arizona, USA. Night-time variation in
d13CR_leaf of up to 4.6 +/- 0.6 parts per thousand in S. wrightii and
3.0 +/- 0.6 parts per thousand in P. velutina were correlated with
shifts in leaf sucrose concentration, but not with changes in d13C
values of these respiratory substrates. Strong positive correlations
between d13CR_root and root glucose d13C values in P. velutina suggest
large diel changes in d13CR_root (were up to 3.9 parts per thousand)
influenced by short-term changes in d13C of leaf-derived phloem C. No
diel variation in d13CR_root was observed in S. wrightii. Our findings
show that short-term changes in d13CR_leaf and d13CR_root were both
related to substrate isotope composition and concentration. Changes in
substrate limitation or demand for biosynthesis may largely control
short-term variation in the d13C of respired CO2 in these species.},
