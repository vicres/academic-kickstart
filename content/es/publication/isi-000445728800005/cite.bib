 abstract = {Fire is a major factor controlling global carbon (C) and nitrogen (N)
cycling. While direct C and N losses caused by combustion have been
comparably well established, important knowledge gaps remain on postfire
N losses. Here, we quantified both direct C and N combustion losses as
well as postfire gaseous losses (N2O, NO and N-2) and N leaching after a
high-intensity experimental fire in an old shrubland in central Spain.
Combustion losses of C and N were 9.4Mg C/ha and 129kg N/ha,
respectively, representing 66% and 58% of initial aboveground
vegetation and litter stocks. Moreover, fire strongly increased soil
mineral N concentrations by several magnitudes to a maximum of 44kg N/ha
2months after the fire, with N largely originating from dead soil
microbes. Postfire soil emissions increased from 5.4 to 10.1kg N
ha(-1)year(-1) for N-2, from 1.1 to 1.9kg N ha(-1)year(-1) for NO and
from 0.05 to 0.2kg N ha(-1)year(-1) for N2O. Maximal leaching losses
occurred 2months after peak soil mineral N concentrations, but remained
with 0.1kg N ha(-1)year(-1) of minor importance for the postfire N mass
balance. N-15 stable isotope labelling revealed that 33% of the mineral
N produced by fire was incorporated in stable soil N pools, while the
remainder was lost. Overall, our work reveals significant postfire N
losses dominated by emissions of N-2 that need to be considered when
assessing fire effects on ecosystem N cycling and mass balance. We
propose indirect N gas emissions factors for the first postfire year,
equalling to 7.7% (N-2-N), 2.7% (NO-N) and 5.0% (N2O-N) of the direct
fire combustion losses of the respective N gas species.},
