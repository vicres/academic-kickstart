 abstract = {The European Union has recently passed the Nature Restoration Law which, among others, seeks to increase the cover of forest reserves protected for biodiversity and, globally, the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework similarly seeks to expand protected areas. Here we test whether a trade-off exists between protected areas expansion and fire activity, leading to a higher exposure to fire for the population in protected areas, because they often harbor more biomass and occur in remote areas. We analyzed forest fires affecting 14,892,174 ha, and intersecting 10,999 protected areas, across fire-prone European Temperate and Mediterranean forest biomes, and in similar ecosystems within California, Chile and Australia. Protected areas were being disproportionally affected by fire within most Temperate biomes, and fire severity was 20 % higher within protected areas also in Mediterranean biomes. Population in the periphery of forest areas was up to 16 times more likely to be exposed to large wildfires when their environment was within, or near, protected areas. Differences in manageable factors such as fuel loads and road density were primary drivers of the divergence in burned area across protection status, with abiotic factors playing also significant roles. The importance of fuel loads indicates that current plans for expanding strictly protected areas, where no human intervention is allowed, may be particularly problematic from a fire perspective. Wildfire prevention and mitigation must be central goals in the development of conservation/restoration programs to diminish population exposure and fire severity.},
