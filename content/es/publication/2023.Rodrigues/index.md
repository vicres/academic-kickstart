abstract: "Background: Lightning is the most common origin of natural fires, being strongly linked to specific synoptic conditions associated with atmospheric instability, such as dry thunderstorms; dry fuels are required for ignition to take place and for subsequent propagation.Aims: The aim was to predict the daily probability of ignition by exploiting a large dataset of lightning and fire data to anticipate ignition over the entire Iberian Peninsula.Methods: We trained and tested a machine learning model using lightning strikes (>17þinspacemillion) in the period 2009--2015. For each lightning strike, we extracted information relating to fuel condition, structural features of vegetation, topography, and the specific characteristics of the strikes (polarity, intensity and flash density).Key results: Naturally triggered ignitions are typically initiated at higher elevations (above 1000þinspacem above sea level) under conditions of low dead fuel moisture (<10--13%) and moderate live moisture content (Drought Codeþinspace>þinspace300). Negative-polarity lightning strikes (−10þinspacekA) appear to trigger fires more frequently.Conclusions and implications: Our approach was able to provide ignition forecasts at multiple temporal and spatial scales, thus enhancing forest fire risk assessment systems."
