 abstract = {Global warming is projected to increase the frequency and intensity of
droughts in the Mediterranean region, as well as the occurrence of large
fires. Understanding the interactions between drought, fire and plant
responses is therefore important. In this study, we present an
experiment in which rainfall patterns were modified to simulate various
levels of drought in a Mediterranean shrubland of central Spain
dominated by Cistus ladanifer, Erica arborea and Phillyrea angustifolia.
A system composed of automatic rainout shelters with an irrigation
facility was used. It was designed to be applied in vegetation 2 m tall,
treat relatively large areas (36 m(2)), and be quickly dismantled to
perform experimental burning and reassembled back again. Twenty plots
were subjected to four rainfall treatments from early spring: natural
rainfall, long-term average rainfall (2 months drought), moderate
drought (25% reduction from long-term rainfall, 5 months drought) and
severe drought (45% reduction, 7 months drought). The plots were burned
in late summer, without interfering with rainfall manipulations. Results
indicated that rainfall manipulations caused differences in soil
moisture among treatments, leading to reduced water availability and
growth of C. ladanifer and E. arborea in the drought treatments.
However, P. angustifolia was not affected by the manipulations. Rainout
shelters had a negligible impact on plot microenvironment. Experimental
burns were of high fire intensity, without differences among treatments.
Our system provides a tool to study the combined effects of drought and
fire on vegetation, which is important to assess the threats posed by
climate change in Mediterranean environments.},
