 abstract = {Background: Molecular clocks drive oscillations in leaf photosynthesis,
stomatal conductance, and other cell and leaf-level processes over
similar to 24 h under controlled laboratory conditions. The influence of
such circadian regulation over whole-canopy fluxes remains uncertain;
diurnal CO2 and H2O vapor flux dynamics in the field are currently
interpreted as resulting almost exclusively from direct physiological
responses to variations in light, temperature and other environmental
factors. We tested whether circadian regulation would affect plant and
canopy gas exchange at the Montpellier European Ecotron. Canopy and
leaf-level fluxes were constantly monitored under field-like
environmental conditions, and under constant environmental conditions
(no variation in temperature, radiation, or other environmental cues).
Results: We show direct experimental evidence at canopy scales of the
circadian regulation of daytime gas exchange: 20-79 % of the daily
variation range in CO2 and H2O fluxes occurred under circadian
entrainment in canopies of an annual herb (bean) and of a perennial
shrub (cotton). We also observed that considering circadian regulation
improved performance by 8-17 % in commonly used stomatal conductance
models.
Conclusions: Our results show that circadian controls affect diurnal CO2
and H2O flux patterns in entire canopies in field-like conditions, and
its consideration significantly improves model performance. Circadian
controls act as a `memory' of the past conditions experienced by the
plant, which synchronizes metabolism across entire plant canopies.},
