 abstract = {Studies on the dependence of the rates of ecosystem gas exchange on
environmental parameters often rely on the up-scaling of leaf-level
response curves ('bottom-up' approach), and/or the down-scaling of
ecosystem fluxes ('top-down' approach), where one takes advantage of the
natural diurnal covariation between the parameter of interest and
photosynthesis rates. Partly independent from environmental variation,
molecular circadian clocks drive similar to 24 h oscillations in
leaf-level photosynthesis, stomatal conductance and other physiological
processes in plants under controlled laboratory conditions. If present
and of sufficient magnitude at ecosystem scales, circadian regulation
could lead to different results when using the bottom-up approach (where
circadian regulation exerts a negligible influence over fluxes because
the environment is modified rapidly) relative to the top-down approach
(where circadian regulation could affect fluxes as it requires the
passage of a few hours). Here we dissected the drivers of diurnal net
CO2 exchange in canopies of an annual herb (bean) and of a perennial
shrub (cotton) through a set of experimental manipulations to test for
the importance of circadian regulation of net canopy CO2 exchange,
relative to that of temperature and vapor pressure deficit, and to
understand whether circadian regulation could affect the derivation of
environmental flux dependencies. Contrary to conventional wisdom, we
observed how circadian regulation exerted controls over net CO2 exchange
that were of similar magnitude to the controls exerted by direct
physiological responses to temperature and vapor pressure deficit.
Diurnal patterns of net CO2 exchange could only be explained by
considering effects of environmental responses combined with circadian
effects. Consequently, we observed significantly different results when
inferring the dependence of photosynthesis over temperature and vapor
pressure deficit when using the top-down and the bottom up approaches.
