 abstract = {In fire-prone environments, the ``event-dependent hypothesisâ€³ states
that plant population changes are driven by the unique set of conditions
of a fire (e. g. fire season, climate). Climate variability, in
particular changes in rainfall patterns, can be most important for
seeder species, since they regenerate after fire from seeds, and for
Mediterranean shrublands, given the high yearly variability of rainfall
in these ecosystems. Yet, the role of rainfall variability and its
interaction with fire characteristics (e. g. fire season) on plant
populations has received little attention. Here we investigated the
changes in seedling emergence and recruitment of three seeder species
(Cistus ladanifer, Erica umbellata and Rosmarinus officinalis) after
fires lit during three different years and at two times (early and late)
during the fire season. Three plots were burned at each season, for a
total of 18 plots burned during the three years. After fire, emerged
seedlings were tallied, tagged and monitored during three years (two in
the last burning year). Rainfall during the study period was rather
variable and, in some years, it was well below average. Postfire
seedling emergence varied by a factor of 3 to 12, depending on the
species and on the burning year. The bulk of seedling emergence occurred
during the first year after fire; seedling recruitment at the end of the
study period was tightly correlated with this early emergence. Emergence
in Erica and Rosmarinus, but not in Cistus, was correlated with
precipitation in the fall and winter immediately after fire, with Erica
being the most sensitive to reduced rainfall. Fire season was generally
neither an important factor in controlling emergence nor, in particular,
recruitment. We discuss how projected changes in rainfall patterns with
global warming could alter the balance of species in this shrubland, and
could drive some species to near local extinction.},
