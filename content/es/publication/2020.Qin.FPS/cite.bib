 abstract = {Stomatal closure is one of the earliest responses to water stress but residual water losses may continue through the cuticle and incomplete stomatal closure. Residual conductance (g<sub>res</sub>) plays a large role in determining time to mortality but we currently do not understand how do drought and shade interact to alter g<sub>res</sub> because the underlying drivers are largely unknown. Furthermore, g<sub>res</sub> may play an important role in models of water use, but the exact form in which g<sub>res</sub> should be incorporated into modeling schemes is currently being discussed. Here we report the results of a study where two different oak species were experimentally subjected to highly contrasting levels of drought (resulting in 0, 50 and 80% losses of hydraulic conductivity) and radiation (photosynthetic photon flux density at 1,500 μmol m<sup>–2</sup> s<sup>–1</sup> or 35–45 μmol m<sup>–2</sup> s<sup>–1</sup>). We observed that the effects of radiation and drought were interactive and species-specific and g<sub>res</sub> correlated positively with concentrations of leaf non-structural carbohydrates and negatively with leaf nitrogen. We observed that different forms of measuring g<sub>res</sub>, based on either nocturnal conductance under high atmospheric water demand or on the water mass loss of detached leaves, exerted only a small influence on a model of stomatal conductance and also on a coupled leaf gas exchange model. Our results indicate that, while understanding the drivers of g<sub>res</sub> and the effects of different stressors may be important to better understand mortality, small differences in g<sub>res</sub> across treatments and measurements exert only a minor impact on stomatal models in two closely related species.},
