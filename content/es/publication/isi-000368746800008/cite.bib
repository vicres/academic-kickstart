 abstract = {Spatially explicit predictions of fuel moisture content are crucial for
quantifying fire danger indices and as inputs to fire behaviour models.
Remotely sensed predictions of fuel moisture have typically focused on
live fuels; but regional estimates of dead fuel moisture have been less
common. Here we develop and test the spatial application of a recently
developed dead fuel moisture model, which is based on the exponential
decline of fine fuel moisture with increasing vapour pressure deficit
(D). We first compare the performance of two existing approaches to
predict D from satellite observations. We then use remotely sensed D, as
well as D estimated from gridded daily weather observations, to predict
dead fuel moisture. We calibrate and test the model at a woodland site
in South East Australia, and then test the model at a range of sites in
South East Australia and Southern California that vary in vegetation
type, mean annual precipitation (129-1404 mm year(-1)) and leaf area
index (0.1-5.7). We found that D modelled from remotely sensed land
surface temperature performed slightly better than a model which also
included total precipitable water (MAE < 1.16 kPa and 1.62 kPa
respectively). D calculated with observations from the Moderate
Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) on the Terra satellite was
under-predicted in areas with low leaf area index. Both D from remotely
sensed data and gridded weather station data were good predictors of the
moisture content of dead suspended fuels at validation sites, with mean
absolute errors less than 3.9% and 6.0% respectively. The occurrence
of data gaps in remotely sensed time series presents an obstacle to this
approach, and assimilated or extrapolated meteorological observations
may offer better continuity. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},
