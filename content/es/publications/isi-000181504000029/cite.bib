 abstract = {Forest management has actively reduced proportion of deciduous trees in
Fennoscandian managed forests. Several species of cryptogams and
invertebrates depend on deciduous trees, among which aspen (Populus
tremula L.) is especially important. The occurrence and abundance of
several terrestrial gastropod species are linked to aspen leaf litter.
However, the impact of forestry practices on the gastropod communities
is largely unknown. We examined difference in species richness,
diversity (H'), and species composition in the gastropod fauna in aspen
stands in a 400 km(2) managed boreal forest area in northern Sweden by
collecting them with masonite boards from 20 selected stands. We
contrasted isolated (>500 m from the neighboring stand) and aggregated
(<300 m from neighboring stand) stands, stands close to arable land (<50
m) and stands in the forest, and used locations outside the aspen stands
in the surrounding forest as controls. Stand sizes ranged from 100 to
3000 m(2).
Gastropod species richness and diversity were high in aspen stands near
arable land and in aggregated stands in the forest and low in controls.
Both diversity and assembly composition of the gastropods in isolated
aspen stands in the forest interior were intermediate between, and did
not differ significantly from, controls and other aspen stands. Species
diversity and richness increased with stand area up to an area of 700
m(2). We conclude that aspen stands in this managed boreal forest
landscape are important for gastropods, even for species that are not
strict habitat specialist connected to aspen. The total amount and the
distribution of aspen in the landscape also may be important, since many
species can be lost if area and connectivity of aspen stands drop to low
levels. The positive species-area relationship suggests that future
forestry practice should favor stands at least 500 m(2) (0.05 ha)
preferably in connection to other stands. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.
