 abstract = {The circadian clock (the endogenous mechanism that anticipates diurnal
cycles) acts as a central coordinator of plant activity. At the
molecular and organism level, it regulates key traits for plant fitness,
including seed germination, gas exchange, growth and flowering, among
others. In this article, we explore current evidence on the effect of
the clock for the scales of interest to ecologists. We begin by
synthesizing available knowledge on the effect of the clock on
biosphere-atmosphere interactions and observe that, at least in the
systems where it has been tested, the clock regulates gas exchange from
the leaf to the ecosystem level, and we discuss its implications for
estimates of the carbon balance. Then, we analyse whether incorporating
the action of the clock may help in elucidating the effects of climate
change on plant distributions. Circadian rhythms are involved in
regulating the range of temperatures a species can survive and affects
plant interactions. Finally, we review the involvement of the clock in
key phenological events, such as flowering time and seed germination.
Because the clock may act as a common mechanism affecting many of the
diverse branches of ecology, our ultimate goal is to stimulate further
research into this pressing, yet unexplored, topic.},
