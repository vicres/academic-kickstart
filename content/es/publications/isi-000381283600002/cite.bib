 abstract = {Atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) concentrations are expected to increase
throughout this century, potentially fostering tree growth. A wealth of
studies have examined the variation in CO2 responses across tree
species, but the extent of intraspecific variation in response to
elevated CO2 (eCO(2)) has, so far, been examined in individual studies
and syntheses of published work are currently lacking. We conducted a
meta-analysis on the effects of eCO(2) on tree growth (height, stem
biomass and stem volume) and photosynthesis across genotypes to examine
whether there is genetic variation in growth responses to eCO(2) and to
understand their dependence on photosynthesis. We additionally examined
the interaction between the responses to eCO(2) and ozone (O-3), another
global change agent. Most of the published studies so far have been
conducted in juveniles and in Populus spp., although the patterns
observed were not species dependent. All but one study reported
significant genetic variation in stem biomass, and the magnitude of
intraspecific variation in response to eCO(2) was similar in magnitude
to previous analyses on interspecific variation. Growth at eCO(2) was
predictable from growth at ambient CO2 (R(2)aEuro...=aEuro...0.60), and
relative rankings of genotype performance were preserved across CO2
levels, indicating no significant interaction between genotypic and
environmental effects. The growth response to eCO(2) was not correlated
with the response of photosynthesis (PaEuro...> aEuro...0.1), and while
we observed 57.7% average increases in leaf photosynthesis, stem
biomass and volume increased by 36 and 38.5%, respectively, and height
only increased by 9.5%, suggesting a predominant role for carbon
allocation in ultimately driving the response to eCO(2). Finally,
best-performing genotypes under eCO(2) also responded better under
eCO(2) and elevated O-3. Further research needs include widening the
study of intraspecific variation beyond the genus Populus and examining
the interaction between eCO(2) and other environmental stressors. We
conclude that significant potential to foster CO2-induced productivity
gains through tree breeding exists, that these programs could be based
upon best-performing genotypes under ambient conditions and that they
would benefit from an increased understanding on the controls of
allocation.},
