 abstract = {1. A major research focus in population and community ecology is to
establish a mechanistic understanding of plant interactions and
demographic responses. The first step towards this mechanistic approach
relies on understanding the differences in stress caused by different
environmental conditions. Leaf-level photosynthetic rate (A) within and
among plant populations provides important insight into population and
community processes, but is difficult to acquire with sufficient
replication under field conditions. Instead, chlorophyll fluorescence
(F-v/F-m) and predawn water potential (Psi(pd)) are often used in arid
and semi-arid ecosystems.
2. F-v/F-m reflects the photoactivation status of photosystem II (PSII),
whereas Psi(pd) indicates water availability in the rhizosphere. Here we
compare these indices with A in two perennial C-4 grasses (native
Heteropogon contortus and invasive Eragrostis lehmanniana) and in
seedlings of the C-3 shrub Prosopis velutina growing on highly
contrasting sandy loam and loamy clay soils in experimental plots.
Measurements were made the day prior to and up to 7 days following a
39-mm rainfall pulse after 2 months of drought.
3. A was more sensitive across a broad range of environmental
conditions, whereas F-v/F-m and Psi(pd) only responded to periods of
protracted drought. The use of these measures was further complicated
because their values varied daily and we observed different time-lags in
their response to precipitation pulses.
4. We suggest sampling schemes and a priori measurements to capture the
value that is representative for the question of interest, and that
match the pulsed biological activity in these ecosystems. Finally, we
suggest the use of these measures in combination with measurements
providing integration over longer time periods, such as delta C-13,
delta O-18 and N concentration in bulk leaf tissue.},
