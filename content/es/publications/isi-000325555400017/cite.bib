 abstract = {The role of the circadian clock in controlling the metabolism of entire
trees has seldom been considered. We tested whether the clock influences
nocturnal whole-tree water use. Whole-tree chambers allowed the control
of environmental variables (temperature, relative humidity). Night-time
stomatal conductance (g(s)) and sap flow (Q) were monitored in 6- to
8-m-tall Eucalyptus globulus trees during nights when environmental
variables were kept constant, and also when conditions varied with time.
Artificial neural networks were used to quantify the relative importance
of circadian regulation of g(s) and Q. Under a constant environment,
g(s) and Q declined from 0 to 6h after dusk, but increased from 6 to 12h
after dusk. While the initial decline could be attributed to multiple
processes, the subsequent increase is most consistent with circadian
regulation of g(s) and Q. We conclude that endogenous regulation of g(s)
is an important driver of night-time Q under natural environmental
variability. The proportion of nocturnal Q variation associated with
circadian regulation (23-56%) was comparable to that attributed to
vapor pressure deficit variation (25-58%). This study contributes to
our understanding of the linkages between molecular and cellular
processes related to circadian regulation, and whole-tree processes
related to ecosystem gas exchange in the field.},
