I am a Professor of Forest Science and Global Change at the University of Lleida and coordinator of the Joint Research Unit between the Forest Technology Center of Catalonia and Agrotecnio [(JRU CTFC-AGROTECNIO)](https://jru.agrotecnio.ctfc.cat).
I was a Ramón y Cajal Fellow (2014-2019) and a faculty member at the Hawkesbury Institute for the Environment (Western Sydney University, 2011-2014). 

I have written a book about [Plant-Fire Interactions](https://www.rescodedios.com/publication/rescode-dios-2020/), over 100 [scientific papers](https://www.rescodedios.com/publication/), and I have been included in the
[Stanford ranking of highly cited scientists](https://elsevier.digitalcommonsdata.com/datasets/btchxktzyw) since 2021. My two main lines of research are:


1)  **Forests and climate change:** On the relationship between forests, CO2 and climate change effects. 
2) **Fire science and management:** On the effects of climate change on the fire regimes and its consequences for health, safety and terrestrial ecosystems. 

I am a member of the Editorial Boards of [New Phytologist](https://nph.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/14698137), [Regional Environmental Change](https://www.springer.com/journal/10113), [Trees](https://www.springer.com/journal/468), [Plant Ecology and Diversity](https://www.tandfonline.com/loi/tped20), [Forests](https://www.mdpi.com/journal/forests), [Forest Systems](http://revistas.inia.es/index.php/fs) and [Frontiers in Forests and Global Change](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/forests-and-global-change). 

I also collaborate with different fire agencies and I've written quite a few popular science articles, [most of them are in Spanish](https://www.rescodedios.com/es/prensa/), but a few are [in English as well](#outreach).
