Dr Resco de Dios is a professor on Forest Fires and Global Change. He obtained his PhD from the University of Wyoming (2008). 
He has written a book about [Plant-Fire Interactions](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-030-41192-3), over 100 [scientific articles](https://www.rescodedios.com/es/publication/)
 and is currently listed as a highly cited scientist in Biology in the [Scopus ranking](https://elsevier.digitalcommonsdata.com/datasets/btchxktzyw/3). 

He is primarily interested on how plants regulate the trade-off between carbon acquisition and water losses and on the implications of this regulation 
for a variety of processes ranging from plant growth, to changes in wildfire activity. His two main lines of research are:

**Rhythmic ecology:** Exploring diurnal, seasonal and annual rhythms in plant growth, reproduction and gas exchange and how they are driven by the interplay between circadian vs exogenous factors.

**Pyrophysiology:** Trying to understand the physiological mechanisms that affect fire activity and, at the same time, how fires shape plant species structure and function.

He is a member of the editorial boards of seven international journals (including [New Phytologist](https://nph.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/14698137), 
[Regional Environmental Change](https://www.springer.com/journal/10113), [Trees](https://www.springer.com/journal/468)) 
and was invited to collaborate in the last two Assessment Reports from the IPCC. He is external adviser for a company of space technologies (AISTECH). 
He regularly writes popular science articles, which have been published by BBC World, El País, ABC, Infobae and other major newspapers in Spain and Latin America. He is regularly asked for comment on forests and wildfire issues globally.


His popular science articles (mostly in Spanish) are available [here](https://www.rescodedios.com/es/prensa/) and his scientific publications are listed [here](https://www.rescodedios.com/publication/).
