 abstract = {Understanding the mechanisms underlying the response of different plant
functional types to current and projected changes in rainfall is
particularly important in drought-prone areas like the Mediterranean.
Here, we report the responses of two species with contrasting leaf
characteristics and post-fire regeneration strategies (Cistus ladanifer
L., malacophyllous, seeder; Erica arborea L., sclerophyllous,
resprouter) to a manipulative field experiment that simulated a severe
drought (45% reduction of historical average rainfall). We measured
monthly changes in relative growth rate (RGR), specific leaf area (SLA),
bulk leaf carbon isotope composition (delta C-13), predawn water
potential (Psi(pd)), photosynthetic gas exchange, bulk modulus of
elasticity and osmotic potential at maximum turgor (pi). Temporal
(monthly) changes in RGR of C. ladanifer were correlated with all
measured leaf traits (except pi) and followed Psi(pd) variation.
However, the temporal pattern of RGR in E. arborea was largely unrelated
to water availability. SLA monthly variation reflected RGR variation
reasonably well in C. ladanifer, but not in E. arborea, in which shoot
growth and delta C-13 increased at the time of maximum water stress in
late summer. The relationship between water availability, and RGR and
carbon assimilation in C. ladanifer, and the lack of any relationship in
E. arborea suggest that the former has an enhanced capacity to harness
unpredictable rainfall pulses compared with the latter. These
contrasting responses to water availability indicate that the projected
changes in rainfall with global warming could alter the competitive
ability of these two species, and contribute to changes in plant
dominance in Mediterranean shrublands.},
