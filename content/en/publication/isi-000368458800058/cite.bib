 abstract = {Forests play a key role in the carbon balance of terrestrial ecosystems.
One of the main uncertainties in global change predictions lies in how
the spatiotemporal dynamics of forest productivity will be affected by
climate warming. Here we show an increasing influence of climate on the
spatial variability of tree growth during the last 120 y, ultimately
leading to unprecedented temporal coherence in ring-width records over
wide geographical scales (spatial synchrony). Synchrony in growth
patterns across cold-constrained (central Siberia) and
drought-constrained (Spain) Eurasian conifer forests have peaked in the
early 21st century at subcontinental scales (similar to 1,000 km). Such
enhanced synchrony is similar to that observed in trees co-occurring
within a stand. In boreal forests, the combined effects of recent
warming and increasing intensity of climate extremes are enhancing
synchrony through an earlier start of wood formation and a stronger
impact of year-to-year fluctuations of growing-season temperatures on
growth. In Mediterranean forests, the impact of warming on synchrony is
related mainly to an advanced onset of growth and the strengthening of
drought-induced growth limitations. Spatial patterns of enhanced
synchrony represent early warning signals of climate change impacts on
forest ecosystems at subcontinental scales.},
