 abstract = {Climate change is expected to lead to increases in drought frequency and
severity, with deleterious effects on many ecosystems. Stomatal
responses to changing environmental conditions form the backbone of all
ecosystem models, but are based on empirical relationships and are not
well-tested during drought conditions. Here, we use a dataset of 34
woody plant species spanning global forest biomes to examine the effect
of leaf water potential on stomatal conductance and test the predictive
accuracy of three major stomatal models and a recently proposed model.
We find that current leaf-level empirical models have consistent biases
of over-prediction of stomatal conductance during dry conditions,
particularly at low soil water potentials. Furthermore, the recently
proposed stomatal conductance model yields increases in predictive
capability compared to current models, and with particular improvement
during drought conditions. Our results reveal that including stomatal
sensitivity to declining water potential and consequent impairment of
plant water transport will improve predictions during drought conditions
and show that many biomes contain a diversity of plant stomatal
strategies that range from risky to conservative stomatal regulation
during water stress. Such improvements in stomatal simulation are
greatly needed to help unravel and predict the response of ecosystems to
future climate extremes.},
