 abstract = {Intensification of droughts under climate change is projected to
increase fire frequency in the Mediterranean region. Fires cause direct
emission of greenhouse gases (GHG) such as carbon dioxide (CO2) and
nitrous oxide (N2O), due to the combustion of organic matter, creating a
positive feedback on climate change. However, the potential importance
of indirect GHG emissions due to changes in soil biological and chemical
properties after fire is less well known. Increased soil mineral
nitrogen (N) concentrations after fire pose a risk for increased
emissions of gaseous N, but studies on the post-fire N2O production and
soil N turnover rates (mineralization, nitrification, microbial
immobilization, denitrification) are still rare. We determined N2O
production, rates of N turnover and pathways for N2O production from the
soil of burned and unburned plots of a Macchia shrubland in central
Spain using a N-15 labelling approach. Measurements were initiated
before the controlled burning and continued for up to half a year after
fire. Fire markedly increased the risk of N2O emissions from soil
through denitrification (N2O production rate was 3 to approximate to 30
times higher in burned soils compared to control, with N2O being
produced solely from soil nitrate). In contrast, soil gross N cycling
rates were not accelerated after fire. Thus, the increased N2O
production was not closely linked with N mineralization, but may be
explained by increased mineral N availability from ash, increased pH in
burned plots, and less competition for available N and C sources due to
absence of plants. (c) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},
