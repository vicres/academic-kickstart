 abstract = {The self-heating correction is known to modify open-path eddy covariance
estimates of net ecosystem CO(2) exchange, typically towards reduced
uptake or enhanced emissions, but with a magnitude heretofore not
generally documented. We assess the magnitude of this correction to be
of order 1 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) (daytime) for half-hourly fluxes and
consistently over 100g Cm(-2) for annual integrations, across a tower
network (CARBORED-ES) spanning climate zones from Mediterranean
temperate to cool alpine. We furthermore examine the sensitivity of the
correction to its determining factors. Due to significant diurnal
variation, the means of discriminating day versus night can lead to
differences of up to several tens of g C m(-2) year(-1). Since its
principal determinants - temperature and wind speed - do not include gas
flux data, the annual correction can be estimated using only
meteorological data so as to avoid uncertainties introduced when filling
gaps in flux data. For fast retro-correction of annual integrations
published prior to the recognition of this instrument surface heating
effect, the annual impact can be roughly approximated to within 12 g C
m-2 year-1 by a linear function of mean annual temperature. These
determinations highlight the need for the flux community to reach a
consensus regarding the need for and the specific form of this
correction. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},
