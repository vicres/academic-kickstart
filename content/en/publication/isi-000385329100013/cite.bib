 abstract = {The study of intra-specific variations in growth and plant physiological
response to drought is crucial to understand the potential for plant
adaptation to global change. Carbon isotope composition (delta C-13) in
plant tissues offers an integrated measure of intrinsic water-use
efficiency (WUEi). The intra-specific association between delta C-13 and
productivity has been extensively studied in herbaceous crops, but
species specific information on woody plants is still limited and has so
far provided contradictory results. In this work we explored the general
patterns of the relationship between delta C-13 and growth traits
(height, diameter and biomass) using a meta-analysis. We compiled
information from 49 articles, including 176 studies performed on 34
species from 16 genera. We found a positive global intra-specific
correlation between delta C-13 and growth (Gr = 0.28, P < 0.0001),
stronger for biomass than for height, and non-significant for diameter.
The extent of this intra-specific association increased from
Mediterranean to subtropical, temperate and boreal biomes, i.e. from
water-limited to energy-limited environments. Conifers and shrubs, but
not broadleaves, showed consistent positive intra-specific correlations.
The meta-analysis also revealed that the relationship between delta C-13
and growth is better characterized at juvenile stages, under
near-optimal and controlled conditions, and by analyzing delta C-13 in
leaves rather than in wood. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights
