 abstract = {As global changes reorganize plant communities, invasive plants may
benefit. We hypothesized that elevated CO2 and warming would strongly
influence invasive species success in a semi-arid grassland, as a result
of both direct and water-mediated indirect effects.
To test this hypothesis, we transplanted the invasive forb Linaria
dalmatica into mixed-grass prairie treated with free-air CO2 enrichment
and infrared warming, and followed survival, growth, and reproduction
over 4 yr. We also measured leaf gas exchange and carbon isotopic
composition in L. dalmatica and the dominant native C-3 grass Pascopyrum
smithii.
CO2 enrichment increased L. dalmatica biomass 13-fold, seed production
32-fold, and clonal expansion seven-fold, while warming had little
effect on L. dalmatica biomass or reproduction. Elevated CO2 decreased
stomatal conductance in P. smithii, contributing to higher soil water,
but not in L. dalmatica. Elevated CO2 also strongly increased L.
dalmatica photosynthesis (87% versus 23% in P. smithii), as a result
of both enhanced carbon supply and increased soil water.
More broadly, rapid growth and less conservative water use may allow
invasive species to take advantage of both carbon fertilization and
water savings under elevated CO2. Water-limited ecosystems may therefore
be particularly vulnerable to invasion as CO2 increases.},
