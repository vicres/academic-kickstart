 abstract = {Predicting the seasonal dynamics of ecosystem carbon fluxes is
challenging in broadleaved evergreen forests because of their moderate
climates and subtle changes in canopy phenology. We assessed the
climatic and biotic drivers of the seasonality of net
ecosystem-atmosphere CO2 exchange (NEE) of a eucalyptus-dominated forest
near Sydney, Australia, using the eddy covariance method. The climate is
characterised by a mean annual precipitation of 800 mm and a mean annual
temperature of 18 degrees C, hot summers and mild winters, with highly
variable precipitation. In the 4-year study, the ecosystem was a sink
each year (-225 g Cm-2 yr(-1) on average, with a standard deviation of
108 g Cm-2 yr(-1)); inter-annual variations were not related to
meteorological conditions. Daily net C uptake was always detected during
the cooler, drier winter months (June through August), while net C loss
occurred during the warmer, wetter summer months (December through
February). Gross primary productivity (GPP) seasonality was low, despite
longer days with higher light intensity in summer, because vapour
pressure deficit (D) and air temperature (T-a) restricted surface
conductance during summer while winter temperatures were still high
enough to support photosynthesis. Maximum GPP during ideal environmental
conditions was significantly correlated with remotely sensed enhanced
vegetation index (EVI; r(2) = 0.46) and with canopy leaf area index
(LAI; r(2) = 0.29), which increased rapidly after mid-summer rainfall
events. Ecosystem respiration (ER) was highest during summer in wet
soils and lowest during winter months. ER had larger seasonal amplitude
compared to GPP, and therefore drove the seasonal variation of NEE.
Because summer carbon uptake may become increasingly limited by
atmospheric demand and high temperature, and because ecosystem
respiration could be enhanced by rising temperatures, our results
suggest the potential for large-scale seasonal shifts in NEE in
sclerophyll vegetation under climate change.},
