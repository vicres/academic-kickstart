 abstract = {We review the relevance and use of stable isotopes for the study of
plant community succession. Stable isotope measurements provide
information on the origin of resources acquired by plants, the processes
governing resource uptake and transformation, and the physiological and
environmental conditions of plant growth. When combined with
measurements of the stable isotope ratio values of soil microbial
biomass, soil organic matter and plant litter, isotope measurements of
plants can indicate effects of successional changes on ecosystem
processes. However, their application to questions of plant succession
and ecosystem change is limited by the degree to which the underlying
assumptions are met in each study, and complementary measures may be
required, depending upon the question of interest. First, we discuss the
changes that occur in the stable isotope composition of plants and
ecosystems with ontogeny and species replacements, as well as their
potential evolutionary significance. Second, we discuss the imprints of
plant competition and facilitation on leaf and wood tissue, as well as
how stable isotopes can provide novel insights on the mechanisms
underlying plant interactions. Finally, we discuss the capacity for
stable isotope measurements to serve as a proxy record for past
disturbances such as fire, logging and cyclones.},
