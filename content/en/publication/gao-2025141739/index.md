abstract: "Chlorophylls and carotenoids are crucial for photosynthesis and plant survival, with ORANGE (OR) protein being pivotal in pigment accumulation. Despite tomato being rich in carotenoids, the roles of OR proteins in tomato have been overlooked. Herein, we characterized two OR genes in tomato, SlOR and SlOR-like, which are highly expressed in stems, leaves, and flowers, with their proteins being localized to chloroplasts. Overexpression of SlOR in transgenic plants conferred enhanced growth and height, whereas co-silencing of SlOR and SlOR-like resulted in stunted growth, pale-green leaves due to diminished chlorophylls and carotenoids, and fewer thylakoid lamellae and layers. Under normal light, SlOR/SlOR-like-Ri transgenic plants exhibited compromised electron transport and photosynthetic rates; furthermore, high-light exposure exacerbated these effects, resulting in photooxidative stress, elevated reactive oxygen species (ROS) and reduced photosynthetic rates in SlOR/SlOR-like-Ri plants. Transcriptome analysis revealed that photosynthesis-related genes were up-regulated, while defense-related genes were significantly down-regulated in SlOR/SlOR-like-Ri lines relative to wild-type plants. Additionally, SlOR/SlOR-like-Ri plants also displayed enhanced susceptibility to Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato DC3000. Overall, our study highlights SlOR as a critical protein modulating the accumulation of chlorophylls and carotenoids in tomato, playing a crucial role in adaptation to high light conditions and pathogen resistance."
