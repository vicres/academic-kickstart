 abstract = {Spatial synchrony refers to the presence of a common signal for a
time-varying characteristic that, in dendrosciences, is shared among
tree-ring chronologies from a particular area. Analysis and
interpretation of synchrony patterns in tree-ring networks is currently
limited by: (i) the requirement for flexible modelling of complex
correlations and heteroscedastic errors and (ii) the availability of
ready-to-use open software to fulfil this task. We present an R package
(DendroSync) that facilitates estimating and plotting synchrony patterns
for pre-defined groups. The package has been devised to work with traits
derived from tree rings (e.g. ring-width), but other data types are also
suitable. It combines variance-covariance mixed modelling with functions
that quantify the degree to which tree-ring chronologies contain a
common signal over a fixed time period. It also estimates temporal
changes in synchrony using a moving window algorithm. The functionality
and usage of DendroSync are illustrated using a simple example.},
