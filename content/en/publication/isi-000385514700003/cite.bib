 abstract = {1. Leaf economics and hydraulic traits strongly influence
photosynthesis. While the level of coordination among these traits can
differ between sets of species, leaf functional trait coordination
within species remains poorly understood. Furthermore, elevated
concentrations of atmospheric CO2 commonly influence the expression of
leaf photosynthetic, economics and hydraulic traits in contrasting ways,
yet the effect of variable concentrations of atmospheric CO2 on patterns
of trait coordination within species remains largely untested.
2. We examined the relationships among key leaf photosynthetic (e. g.
net photosynthesis and photosynthetic biochemistry), economics and
water-use (e. g. leaf mass per unit area and stomatal conductance) and
hydraulic traits (e. g. vein density) in 14 genotypes of Eucalyptus
camaldulensis grown in ambient (aCO(2)) and elevated (eCO(2)) [CO2].
We examined the level of coordination among leaf traits in aCO(2) and
then assessed whether growth in eCO(2) altered that coordination.
3. We found that leaf traits related to photosynthetic capacity,
economics and water-use, and hydraulics were decoupled among genotypes
grown in aCO(2), yet strong relationships were generally observed among
suites of traits within each `functional group'.
4. Significant responses to growth in eCO(2) were observed for most leaf
photosynthetic and economics and water-use traits, with the magnitude
and direction of the response varying among traits. In contrast, leaf
hydraulics traits were unaffected by variable growth CO2. Despite this,
growth in eCO(2) did not substantially alter patterns of leaf trait
coordination observed in aCO(2).
5. These results suggest suites of leaf traits associated with
photosynthetic capacity, economics and water-use and hydraulics,
respectively, can form independent axes of variation among genotypes of
a single species, regardless of growth CO2. Although growth in eCO(2)
did not substantially alter patterns of trait coordination, decoupling
of leaf functional traits among genotypes may allow genetically distinct
populations to produce novel combinations of traits that may be adaptive
in response to changes in their local environment.},
