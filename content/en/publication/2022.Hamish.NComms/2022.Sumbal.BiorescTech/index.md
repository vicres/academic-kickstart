abstract: "The slow decomposition rate of the reluctant structure of lignocellulose in agricultural waste is the great limitation of composting processes, which can be averted by pretreatment-strategies. This study focused on the impacts of pretreating rice straw using a consortium of newly isolated fungal species on lignocellulose degradation and humic substances during composting. Fungal pretreatment had a significant impact on lignocellulose degradation (84%) of rice straw by producing higher lignocellulytic enzymes than chemical pretreatments (79%) or the control (61%). The compost with fungal pretreated rice straw (FPT) showed significantly high composting temperature in the late mesophilic stage, which enhanced the degradation of lignocellulose. The fluorescence excitation emission spectroscopy revealed that significantly more humic acid-like compounds were formed in FPT. These findings suggest that fungal pretreatment is a feasible method to accelerate straw degradation and humification."
