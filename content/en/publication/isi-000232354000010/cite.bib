 abstract = {Dwarf bamboo creates a dense carpet that prevents forest regeneration in
mixed forests of Japan. Soil-scarification has been used widely to
regenerate such forests. However, no study has specifically addressed
the effects of soil-scarification on regeneration dynamics following
such perturbation. This study analyzed the demography and community
structure of the most abundant species 6 years after soil-scarification
in a mixed forest stand of Northern Japan. We used canonical
correspondence analysis (CCA) to analyze environmental factors effects
on species distribution. Using multiple regression analysis, we
determined the net balance of competition and facilitation.
Abies sachalinensis and Picea glehnii are the most abundant species;
Betula sp. and Salix bakko are the largest ones. Increasing distance to
the edge of the scarified area is generally concomitant with decreasing
seedling density, but changes in extension growth show idiosyncratic
responses. These results, together with those of CCA, suggest that light
is the main factor directly affecting (with high levels of irradiance)
and indirectly affecting (by changing volumetric soil water content)
seedling demography and structure. Multiple regression analyses show
that facilitation is the most important interaction affecting seedling
growth, probably by reducing excess levels of irradiance. (c) 2005
