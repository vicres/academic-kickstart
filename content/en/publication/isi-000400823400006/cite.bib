 abstract = {Measurements of competition and facilitation between plants often rely
upon intensity and importance indices that quantify the net effect of
neighbours on the performance of a target plant. A systematic analysis
of the mathematical behaviour of the indices is lacking and leads to
structural pitfalls, e.g. statistical problems detected in importance
indices. We summarize and analyse the mathematical properties that the
indices should display. We review the properties of the commonly used
indices focusing on standardization and symmetry, which are necessary to
avoid compromising data interpretation. We introduce a new family of
indices Neighbour-effect Indices' that meetall the proposed properties.
Considering the commonly used indices, none of the importance indices
are standardized, and only RII (Relative Interaction Index) displays all
the required mathematical properties. The existing indices show two
types of symmetries, namely, additive or commutative, which are
currently confounded, potentially resulting in misleading
interpretations. Our Neighbour-effect Indices encompass two intensity
and two importance indices that are standardized and have different and
defined symmetries. Our new additive intensity index, NInt(A), is the
first of its kind, and it is generally more suitable for assessing
competition and facilitation intensity than the widely used RII, which
may underestimate facilitation. Our new standardized importance indices
solve the main statistical problems that are known to affect C-imp and
I-imp. Intensity and importance with the same symmetry should be used
within the same study. The Neighbour-effect Indices, sharing the same
formulation, will allow for unbiased comparisons between intensity and
importance, and between types of symmetry.},
