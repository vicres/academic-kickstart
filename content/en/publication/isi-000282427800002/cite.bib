 abstract = {Two years of continuous measurements of net ecosystem exchange (NEE)
using the eddy covariance technique were made over a Mediterranean
alpine shrubland. This ecosystem was found to be a net source of CO2 (+
52 +/- 7 g C m(-2) and + 48 +/- 7 g C m(-2) for 2007 and 2008) during
the two-year study period. To understand the reasons underlying this net
release of CO2 into the atmosphere, we analysed the drivers of seasonal
variability in NEE over these two years. We observed that the soil water
availability - driven by the precipitation pattern - and the
photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD) are the key factors for
understanding both the carbon sequestration potential and the duration
of the photosynthetic period during the growing season. Finally, the
effects of the self-heating correction to CO2 and H2O fluxes measured
with the open-path infrared gas analyser were evaluated. Applying the
correction turned the annual CO2 budget in 2007 from a sink (-135 +/- 7
g C m(-2)) to a source (+ 52 +/- 7 g C m(-2)). The magnitude of this
change is larger than reported previously and is shown to be due to the
low air density and cold temperatures at this high elevation study site.},
