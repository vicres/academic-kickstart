 abstract = {High nocturnal transpiration rates (5-15% of total water loss in
terrestrial plants) may be adaptive under limited fertility, by
increasing nutrient uptake or transport via transpiration-induced mass
flow, but the response of stomata in the dark to environmental variables
is poorly understood. Here we tested the impact of soil phosphorous (P)
concentration, atmospheric CO2 concentration and air temperature on
stomatal conductance (g(s)) during early and late periods in the night,
as well as at midday in naturally, sun-lit glasshouse-grown Eucalyptus
tereticornis Sm. seedlings. Soil P was the main driver of nocturnal
g(s), which was consistently higher in low soil P (37.3-79.9 mmol m(-2)
s(-1)) than in high soil P (17.7-49.3 mmol m(-2-1)). Elevated
temperature had only a marginal (P = 0.07) effect on g(s) early in the
night (g(s) decreased from 34.7 to 25.8 mmol m(-2) s(-1) with an
increase in temperature of 4 degrees C). The effect of CO2 depended on
its interaction with temperature. Stomatal conductance responses to soil
P were apparently driven by indirect effects of soil P on plant anatomy,
since g(s) was significantly and negatively correlated with wood
density. However, the relationship of g(s) with environmental factors
became weaker late in the night, relative to early in the night, likely
due to apparent endogenous processes; g(s) late in the night was two
times larger than g(s) observed early in the night. Time-dependent
controls over nocturnal g(s) suggest that daytime stomatal models may
not apply during the night, and that different types of regulation may
occur even within a single night. We conclude that the enhancement of
nocturnal g(s) under low soil P availability is unlikely to be adaptive
in our species because of the relatively small amount of
transpiration-induced mass flow that can be achieved through rates of
nocturnal water loss (3-6% of daytime mass flow).},
