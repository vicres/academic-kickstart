 abstract = {Key message No temporal change was recorded during summer in fuel
availability in Pinus pinaster stands, contrary to predictions from the
Forest Fire Weather Index. Also, thinning had no mid-term effect on fuel
moisture or canopy structure.
Context Forest fires are a major problem in Mediterranean countries.
Management actions, such as fuel reductions, are one of the main tools
to diminish fire risk, but the midterm efficacy of such tools remains
largely untested with empirical data.
Aims Here, we test for midterm effects of thinning on fuel moisture and
crown bulk density in P. pinaster stands and whether temporal variations
in fuel moisture correlated with predictions from the Fire Weather
Index, a commonly used index on fire risk, and its components.
Methods We compared fuel moisture over a fire season and crown bulk
density in nine pairs of thinned/unthinned plots 7 years after
treatments were applied.
Results We observed that fuel moisture remained stable during a fire
season, as a likely result of drought-induced physiological adjustments,
including stomatal regulation and others, which allow leaves to maintain
a large humidity even during drought, and that thinning had no midterm
effect on fuel moisture or crown bulk density. Moreover, the Fire
Weather Index and its components displayed different temporal dynamics
than those observed in fuel moisture.
Conclusion These results are important as they indicate that thinning
may only have a limited, short-term impact towards diminishing the
potential for crown fire spread in these stands and that current indices
to evaluate fire risk may require a re-evaluation.},
