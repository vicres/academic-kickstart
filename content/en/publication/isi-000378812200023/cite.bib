 abstract = {Most studies of climate change effects on fire regimes assume a gradual
reorganization of pyrogeographic patterns and have not considered the
potential for transformational changes in the climate-vegetation-fire
relationships underlying continental-scale fire regimes. Here, we model
current fire activity levels in Australia as a function of mean annual
actual evapotranspiration (E) and potential evapotranspiration (E-0), as
proxies for fuel productivity and fuel drying potential. We distinguish
two domains in E, E-0 space according to the dominant constraint on fire
activity being either fuel productivity (PL-type fire) or fuel dryness
(DL-type fire) and show that the affinity to these domains is related to
fuel type. We propose to assess the potential for transformational
shifts in fire type from the difference in the affinity to either domain
under a baseline climate and projected future climate. Under the
projected climate changes potential for a transformational shift from
DL- to PL-type fire was predicted for mesic savanna woodland in the
north and for eucalypt forests in coastal areas of the south-west and
along the Continental Divide in the south-east of the continent.
Potential for a shift from PL- to DL-type fire was predicted for a
narrow zone of eucalypt savanna woodland in the north-east.},
