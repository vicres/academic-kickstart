 abstract = {Background: Understanding the mechanisms that explain the spatial
distribution of conifers across biogeographical gradients is important
for anticipating potential range shifts owing to global change.
Classical explanations have involved trade-offs between shade and
drought tolerances, but more recent studies observed that trade-offs
between fire and drought tolerances could also be important.Aims: Here
we propose that a contributing mechanism to explain how conifer species
are distributed across productivity gradients - with marked variation in
the incidence of fire - involves a trade-off between allocation to bark,
which serves to protect against fire, or to embolism resistance, which
serves to protect against drought.Methods: We compiled information from
different datasets and performed regression analyses.Results: We
observed a trade-off between bark thickness and embolism resistance in
conifer species such that species show either large investments of
carbon to the bark or have thinner barks but xylem resistant to
embolism; we did not observe conifer species concomitantly showing high
fire tolerance and embolism resistance.Conclusions: This study serves as
a starting point for a novel framework on how fire and drought
adaptations affect conifer biogeography. Additional studies will be
necessary to discover the generality of our findings by including other
species of conifers, for example those in the Southern Hemisphere.},
