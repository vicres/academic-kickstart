 abstract = {Large increases in the density of woody plants in former grasslands have
been documented globally over the past two centuries. Prosopis velutina
(velvet mesquite) has recently expanded on over 38 million ha in the
grasslands of the American southwest.
Mesquite establishment and expansion is potentially influenced by
competitive interactions with grasses, particle size distribution
(texture) of soil and changes in the amount and/or seasonality of
precipitation, amongst other factors.
To investigate the relative importance of precipitation seasonality,
grass competition, and soil texture on mesquite seedling and
establishment, we experimentally manipulated seasonality of
precipitation across 72 1.5 m x 1.7 m plots that we planted with two
grasses from contrasting functional groups (or left unvegetated) across
two highly contrasting soil textures within a semi-desert grassland in
Arizona, USA, wherein we followed the demography of 8640 planted
mesquite seeds between 2002 and 2006. Up to 70% of the variance in
seedling emergence was explained by soil water content, and seedling
mortality was more dependent on summer than on winter precipitation.
Mortality of less drought tolerant grasses after drought in coarse
textured soils created conditions most favorable for seedling
establishment, whereas lower rates of seedling establishment were
observed in finer textured soils or in plots dominated by more drought
tolerant grasses.
We conclude that mesquite encroachment is episodic, based on
discontinuous patterns of seedling establishment, favored on coarse
textured soils and associated with unique conditions of high summer
water availability when precipitation is not limiting and when
competition from grasses is lowered. (c) 2012 Elsevier GmbH. All rights
