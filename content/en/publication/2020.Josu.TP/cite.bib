 abstract = {Dendrometers are being increasingly used to measure stem radius changes in trees and to unravel the mechanisms underlying stem daily rhythms of radial expansion and contraction. Nevertheless, automated dendrometers have not been often used to measure root radius dynamics, their relationship with environmental variables and the influence of endogenous processes, especially in drought-prone Mediterranean areas. Here, we measured root radius dynamics of two coexisting oak species (the evergreen Quercus ilex L. and the deciduous Quercus faginea Lam). Our goals were to describe annual, seasonal and diurnal scale root radius patterns and to disentangle the role of different environmental parameters as drivers. Long-term high-resolution measurements (every 15 min over 7 years) were collected with automated point dendrometers on the main tree roots of five individuals per species. Root radius annual change patterns were bimodal and similar for both oak species. Quercus faginea Lam showed three times larger root increment in the spring than Q. ilex, but the bimodal pattern was stronger in Q. ilex, which showed a larger root increment in autumn. Quercus faginea Lam showed an earlier root phenological activation in the spring and in late summer compared with Q. ilex. The effects of environmental drivers across species were similar at daily scales: root radius increased with air temperature and soil moisture, and it decreased with rising vapor pressure deficit. Furthermore, daily root radius variations for both oak species were maintained after extracting statistically the environmental effects, which points toward a significant role of endogenous drivers. These differences in root radius change patterns at seasonal to daily scales likely result from the differences in leaf phenology and growth strategy. Quercus faginea Lam is deciduous and has a faster growing rate in spring than the evergreen Q. ilex, which can grow more in summer.},
