 abstract = {Nocturnal transpiration constitutes a significant yet poorly understood
component of the global water cycle. Modeling nocturnal transpiration
has been complicated by recent findings showing that stomata respond
differently to environmental drivers over day- vs. night-time periods.
Here, we propose that nocturnal stomatal conductance depends on
antecedent daytime conditions. We tested this hypothesis across six
genotypes of Eucalyptus camaldulensis Dehnh. growing under different CO2
concentrations (ambient vs. elevated) and exposed to contrasting
temperatures (ambient vs. heat wave) for four days prior to the night of
measurements, when all plants experienced ambient temperature
conditions. We observed significant effects after the heat wave that led
to 36% reductions in nocturnal stomatal conductance. The response was
partly driven by changes in daytime stomatal behavior but additional
factors may have come into play. We also observed significant
differences in response to the heat wave across genotypes, likely driven
by local adaptation to their climate of origin, but CO2 played no
effect. Stomatal models may need to incorporate the role of antecedent
effects to improve projections particularly after drastic changes in the
environment such as heat waves.},
